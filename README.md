[00:00.10] Please stay
[00:03.16] Don't put out the flame and run away
[00:08.95] In this heart break
[00:12.28] I'll be here fighting for you
[00:14.35] With or without you
[00:23.85] 
[00:19.04] Wide awake
[00:21.76] With all the things I know that I should say
[00:27.87] I thought I could take
[00:31.03] More than I really can
[00:33.11] With or without you
[00:42.61] 
[00:37.79] Baby 'til you come back with something
[00:42.32] I know I'll never let it go
[00:46.76] I'm waiting but you come back with nothin'
[01:07.76] 
[00:53.74] This obsession has turned, Into The Great Despair
[00:58.46] I keep thinking I see you
[01:00.57] And there's nobody there
[01:03.18] They say love is time
[01:05.26] But all in love isn't fair
[01:07.50] So pull me out of The Great Despair
[01:25.00] 
[01:13.10] Every day
[01:15.78] I'm getting stronger but I still feel the pain
[01:21.89] Time will show the way
[01:24.99] And I'll mend the heart you've broken
[01:27.01] With or without you
[01:31.89] Baby 'til you come back with something (until you come back with something)
[01:36.61] I know I'll never let it go (I know I'll never let it go)
[01:40.87] Your indifference lets you come back with nothin' (you come back with nothin')
[02:19.87] 
[01:47.88] This obsession has turned, Into The Great Despair
[01:52.63] I keep thinking I see you
[01:54.67] And there's nobody there
[01:57.19] They say love is time
[01:59.36] But all in love isn't fair
[02:01.67] So pull me out of The Great Despair
[02:19.17] 
[02:06.55] We watched the world burn down around us
[02:11.35] But we're still standing here
[02:16.03] With a flicker of hope on the darkest of days
[02:20.88] Now it feels like the end is near (feels like the end is near)
[02:25.51] The end (the end)
[02:28.69] Of The Great Despair (Great Despair)
[02:46.69] 
[02:34.85] This obsession has turned, Into The Great Despair
[02:39.61] I keep thinking I see you
[02:52.11] 
[02:44.42] This obsession has turned
[02:46.41] Into The Great Despair
[02:49.37] Now all I see is you
[02:51.49] You're everywhere
[02:53.69] They say love is time
[02:56.05] And now it's time we declare
[02:58.77] Goodbye to The Great Despair (goodbye to The Great Despair)
[03:03.85] Goodbye to The Great Despair
[03:08.26] Goodbye to The Great...
[03:11.93] Despair
